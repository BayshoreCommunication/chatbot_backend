# Multi-Tenant Vector Store Fixes

## Issues Found

1. **Dimension Mismatch**: The OpenAI embeddings dimension (1536) didn't match the Pinecone index dimension (1024).
   - Error: `Vector dimension 1536 does not match the dimension of the index 1024`
   - This caused document uploads to fail silently or vector searches to return no results.

2. **Namespace Handling**: The namespace parameter wasn't being correctly passed in some search operations.
   - Organization-specific namespaces weren't properly applied in all places.
   - This led to documents being stored in the correct namespace but searches not finding them.

3. **Usage Statistics**: The usage statistics weren't properly reporting vector counts from namespaces.
   - This showed 0 vectors even when documents were successfully uploaded.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Embedding Dimension Reduction

- Created `DimensionReducedEmbeddings` wrapper that:
  - Takes OpenAI's 1536-dimensional embeddings
  - Truncates them to 1024 dimensions
  - Normalizes them to ensure proper similarity search

- Set the `PINECONE_DIMENSION` environment variable to `1024` to ensure consistency

### 2. Namespace Handling

- Enhanced namespace handling in `get_org_vectorstore` to explicitly set the namespace attribute
- Updated the search function to try different namespace access methods
- Explicitly passed namespace parameters in all similarity searches

### 3. Debugging Enhancement

- Added extensive debugging logs to track embedding dimensions, vector store operations
- Added namespace introspection to identify where namespace information was being lost
- Created test scripts to verify each part of the system independently

## Successful Implementation

The multi-tenant vector store now:

1. Correctly creates organization-specific namespaces
2. Properly stores documents in organization-specific namespaces
3. Successfully retrieves documents only from the correct namespace
4. Isolates each organization's data from others

## Key Learning Points

1. **Embedding Dimensions**: Always ensure vector dimensions match between the model and the vector database.
2. **Explicit Namespace Parameters**: Always pass the namespace parameter explicitly in all vector operations.
3. **Debugging Tools**: Create focused test scripts that isolate specific parts of the system for easier debugging.
4. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for configuration values that need to be consistent across the application.

## Additional Notes

For improving usage statistics:
- The usage statistics could still be enhanced by directly querying the vector store for accurate vector counts
- Currently, showing a minimum of 1 vector when content is retrievable but count reports 0

The system now successfully provides organization-specific responses based on each organization's uploaded documents.
